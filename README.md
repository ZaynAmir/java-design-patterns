 ## Coupling:
 Imagine you have created two classes, A and B, in your program.
 Class A is called volume, and class B evaluates the volume of a cylinder.
 If you change class A volume, then you are not forced to change class B.
 This is called loose coupling in Java. When class A requires changes in class B,
 then you have tight coupling.


 ## Interface:
 A Contract that specifies the capabilities that a class should provide.
 it don't have the implementation only the declaration.

 ## Encapsulation
 Encapsulation in Java refers to integrating data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit.
 In encapsulation, a class's variables are hidden from other classes and can only be accessed by the methods of the class
 in which they are found.

 Need for Encapsulation:
    Better Control, getter and setters, Security, Flexibility, Data hiding
